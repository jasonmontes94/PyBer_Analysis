# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
We were tasked by V. Visualize to analyze and gather data of her ride-share company PyBer differentiating between rural, suburban, and urban cities.

## Results

At first glance, it is apparent that Urban cities had more total fares than Suburban and Rural cities. 

Urban cities see more total riders and more total drivers, as well as the most total fares. However, individual drivers in Urban cities earned much less per fare than their Suburban and Rural counterparts as seen below.

## Summary

1. In order to increase driver pay in Urban cities, we would suggest limiting the number of total drivers that are active. However, we do not want to reduce total drivers in urban cities below the total ride amount. This would increase average fare per driver, while maintaining the high amount of fares in urban cities.

2. To correct the disparity between average fare per ride and average fare per driver, you can increase the price per fare in rural and suburban areas. This would allow more profit for PyBer while not decreasing the average fare per driver in suburban and rural areas.

3. Lastly, we could increase the amount of drivers in rural and suburban cities. This would provide more total fares, while also reducing the average fare per ride. Depending on how many more drivers we would hire to rural and suburban areas, this should not affect average fare per driver.
